# restaurantmenu

You will be taking a restaurant's menu and styling it into two different designs using CSS.

The included index.html file contains the menu, and a simple navigation bar allowing you to toggle between two different CSS files, style1.css and style2.css. For now, those two files provide very little styling. However, they do contain comments which suggest style rules you can add or modify to provide a more custom appearance.

The two screenshot examples provided show what the restaurant's menu will look like if you complete all the tasks specified in the comments in the two stylesheets.
